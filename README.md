# NgPhotoPerfil

## :hammer_and_wrench: Maintenance :hammer_and_wrench:

I'm sorry but I still don't have a functional mvp that can be used to play. I'm prioritizing the repair of this project :muscle:,
this anime-loving programmer thanks :nerd_face:.

:wrench: :wrench: :wrench: :wrench: :wrench: :wrench:
## Description :memo:

An angular application created to replicate a "photo-profile" game, a game created by the animazon group to be one of
the attractions of the event.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.1.

## Motivation and Inspiration :sparkling_heart:

I, the author of this project, am a member of the animazon group, a cultural, non-profit group whose main objective is
to disseminate through entertainment the Japanese culture in the State of Par√°-Brazil, for more information click here.

So once / twice a year the group organizes an event with various activities open to the public. Among its attractions
there is a game played with the participants of the event called "photo-profile", it uses a program made in flash 8.

This encouraged me to create a project that would replace that program and that could also be used by people in their
homes, to play with your family in this time of covid.

So... How does it work?

## :video_game: The game and its rules :book:

### Format:

Participants stand in line at the front of the stage, the first participates by speaking into the microphone, or only
speaks if played at home.

### Procedures:

The participant in turn chooses one of the numbers on the monitor to be revealed and then can guess who the character
is, in case of an error, go back to the end of the line.

During the first 5 frames chosen, it is not valid to reveal the frames that are adjacent horizontally and vertically in
a revealed section.

At the discretion of the person coordinating the game, the right of reply may remain open to the other positions in the
queue in case of delay.

Eg: 10+ open boards with no correct answer.

## :warning: IMPORTANT NOTE :warning: 

It is worth mentioning that this project is not the one previously described, this is merely a prototype of a game
performed at the event. It has 4 main purposes:

- To serve as a project response to the course "Developing SPA with angle" on the Digital Innovation One platform.

- Improve my knowledge in css / scss animations.

- In the future be used as an example, together with other projects, of my proposal to create a technology area that
  helps all internal / external activities.

- Be the first step towards my world conquest, HAHAHAHAHA :smiling_imp:.
