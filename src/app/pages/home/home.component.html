        I am a member of the animazon group, a cultural, non-profit group whose main objective
        is
        to disseminate through entertainment the Japanese culture in the State of Par√°-Brazil, for more information
        click

        So once / twice a year the group organizes an event with various activities open to the public. Among its
        attractions
        there is a game played with the participants of the event called "photo-profile", it uses a program made in
        flash
        8.
      </p>

      <p>
        This encouraged me to create a project that would replace that program and that could also be used by people in
        their
        homes, to play with your family in this time of covid.
      </p>

      <p>
        So... How does it work?
